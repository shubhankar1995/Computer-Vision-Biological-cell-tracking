Each of the three folders contains four image sequences showing many moving and dividing cells.

The files in each folder are the successive time points of the sequence and are named t***.tif accordingly, where *** is the number of the time point.

For some of the cells in some of the time points in some of the sequences, hand-drawn masks are available for training models, if needed.

Use these images only for the COMP9517 2020 Term 2 Group Project and for no other purpose.

If you want to use these images for other purposes, you are bound by the Conditions of Use of the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC):
